# EV-Grid-Impact-Analysis
This repository contains Python code for eight comprehensive analyses, each organized into a key component:
1. Market share Analysis of EV 
2. Ev adoption (2014-2035 forecasting) 
3. Public charging infrastructure analysis 
4. Regional charger distribution 
5. Charging speed forecasts 
6. Home charging behaviour 
7. Grid capacity analysis 
8. Scenario engine modelling (2018/2025/2030)
